Given the absence of a viable vaccine, the timely and effective treatment of malaria remains a critical priority. However, the growing resistance of parasites to currently utilized drugs underscores the critical need for the identification of new antimalarial therapies. Here, we aimed to identify potential new drug candidates against Plasmodium falciparum, the main causative agent of malaria, by analyzing the transcriptomes of different life stages of the parasite and identifying highly expressed genes. We searched for genes that were expressed in all stages of the parasite\\u2019s life cycle, including the asexual blood stage, gametocyte stage, liver stage, and sexual stages in the insect vector, using transcriptomics data from publicly available databases. From this analysis, we found 674 overlapping genes, including 409 essential ones. By searching through drug target databases, we discovered 70 potential drug targets and 75 associated bioactive compounds. We sought to expand this analysis to similar compounds to known drugs. So, we found a list of 1557 similar compounds, which we predicted as actives and inactives using previously developed machine learning models against five life stages of Plasmodium spp. From this analysis, two compounds were selected, and the reactions were experimentally evaluated. The compounds HSP-990 and silvestrol aglycone showed potent inhibitory activity at nanomolar concentrations against the P. falciparum 3D7 strain asexual blood stage. Moreover, silvestrol aglycone exhibited low cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, transmission-blocking potential, and inhibitory activity comparable to those of established antimalarials. These findings warrant further investigation of silvestrol aglycone as a potential dual-acting antimalarial and transmission-blocking candidate for malaria control.\",\n          \"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved from a computational tool into a transformative force reshaping every branch of engineering. This review paper explores the depth and breadth of AI integration across major engineering disciplines\\u2014including Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics, Computer Science, Civil, Chemical, Aerospace, Biomedical, and Industrial Engineering. By analysing recent advances in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and intelligent automation, the paper highlights how AI enhances design optimization, predictive maintenance, smart manufacturing, structural health monitoring, energy management, autonomous systems, process control, and human\\u2013machine collaboration. The study also examines domain-specific applications such as digital twins, Industry 4.0, AI-driven materials discovery, intelligent transportation, personalized healthcare systems, and sustainable infrastructure development. Furthermore, the paper discusses emerging challenges involving data quality, interoperability, ethics, and the need for interdisciplinary skill development. This comprehensive review demonstrates that AI is not merely an add-on technology but a foundational enabler driving innovation, efficiency, and intelligent decision-making across all engineering fields, shaping the future of global technological advancement.\",\n          \"Everywhere across the globe, banks are increasingly viewing artificial intelligence as a revolutionary force that is likely to transform fraud detection, customer service automation, targeted financial advisory services, and risk management operations. Even with huge investments in AI technologies, many banking organizations face great challenges in deploying machine learning systems at scale in production environments. The main constraint often arises not from algorithmic constraints or lack of data science talent but from substandard technological infrastructure unable to accommodate the scale of modern AI workloads. Legacy banking platforms built many years ago run on batch-processing architectures that are inherently incompatible with real-time data streaming demands necessary for today's machine learning use cases. Mainframe environments using inflexible data schemas cannot support heterogeneous unstructured data sources required for training advanced neural networks, while limitations of aging hardware constrain the computation of intricate algorithms at the enterprise level. Data fragmentation within departmental silos hinders accessibility, undermining model precision and predictive power. Infrastructure modernization is an unavoidable requirement for the effective implementation of AI, involving the adoption of cloud computing for computational elasticity, containerization technologies for standardized deployment across environments, single unified data platforms tying together dissimilar information sources, and compliance-aware architectures meeting very stringent regulatory requirements. Banking organizations are required to address systematic infrastructure constraints through in-depth transformation programs combining technical upgrades with organizational change management, skills development initiatives, and cross-functional collaboration models. Only by conscious infrastructure development can financial services companies release the full transformative power of artificial intelligence and realize enduring competitive gains in ever more digital banking environments.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Given the absence of a viable vaccine, the timely and effective treatment of malaria remains a critical priority. However, the growing resistance of parasites to currently utilized drugs underscores the critical need for the identification of new antimalarial therapies. Here, we aimed to identify potential new drug candidates against Plasmodium falciparum, the main causative agent of malaria, by analyzing the transcriptomes of different life stages of the parasite and identifying highly expressed genes. We searched for genes that were expressed in all stages of the parasite\\u2019s life cycle, including the asexual blood stage, gametocyte stage, liver stage, and sexual stages in the insect vector, using transcriptomics data from publicly available databases. From this analysis, we found 674 overlapping genes, including 409 essential ones. By searching through drug target databases, we discovered 70 potential drug targets and 75 associated bioactive compounds. We sought to expand this analysis to similar compounds to known drugs. So, we found a list of 1557 similar compounds, which we predicted as actives and inactives using previously developed machine learning models against five life stages of Plasmodium spp. From this analysis, two compounds were selected, and the reactions were experimentally evaluated. The compounds HSP-990 and silvestrol aglycone showed potent inhibitory activity at nanomolar concentrations against the P. falciparum 3D7 strain asexual blood stage. Moreover, silvestrol aglycone exhibited low cytotoxicity in mammalian cells, transmission-blocking potential, and inhibitory activity comparable to those of established antimalarials. These findings warrant further investigation of silvestrol aglycone as a potential dual-acting antimalarial and transmission-blocking candidate for malaria control.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_no_noise\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"In tropical and subtropical areas malaria stands as a profound public health challenge causing an estimated  million cases worldwide annually Given the absence of a viable vaccine the timely and effective treatment of malaria remains a critical priority However the growing resistance of parasites to currently utilized drugs underscores the critical need for the identification of new antimalarial therapies Here we aimed to identify potential new drug candidates against Plasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria by analyzing the transcriptomes of different life stages of the parasite and identifying highly expressed genes We searched for genes that were expressed in all stages of the parasites life cycle including the asexual blood stage gametocyte stage liver stage and sexual stages in the insect vector using transcriptomics data from publicly available databases From this analysis we found  overlapping genes including  essential ones By searching through drug target databases we discovered  potential drug targets and  associated bioactive compounds We sought to expand this analysis to similar compounds to known drugs So we found a list of  similar compounds which we predicted as actives and inactives using previously developed machine learning models against five life stages of Plasmodium spp From this analysis two compounds were selected and the reactions were experimentally evaluated The compounds HSP and silvestrol aglycone showed potent inhibitory activity at nanomolar concentrations against the P falciparum D strain asexual blood stage Moreover silvestrol aglycone exhibited low cytotoxicity in mammalian cells transmissionblocking potential and inhibitory activity comparable to those of established antimalarials These findings warrant further investigation of silvestrol aglycone as a potential dualacting antimalarial and transmissionblocking candidate for malaria control\",\n          \"Artificial Intelligence AI has evolved from a computational tool into a transformative force reshaping every branch of engineering This review paper explores the depth and breadth of AI integration across major engineering disciplinesincluding Mechanical Electrical Electronics Computer Science Civil Chemical Aerospace Biomedical and Industrial Engineering By analysing recent advances in machine learning deep learning computer vision natural language processing and intelligent automation the paper highlights how AI enhances design optimization predictive maintenance smart manufacturing structural health monitoring energy management autonomous systems process control and humanmachine collaboration The study also examines domainspecific applications such as digital twins Industry  AIdriven materials discovery intelligent transportation personalized healthcare systems and sustainable infrastructure development Furthermore the paper discusses emerging challenges involving data quality interoperability ethics and the need for interdisciplinary skill development This comprehensive review demonstrates that AI is not merely an addon technology but a foundational enabler driving innovation efficiency and intelligent decisionmaking across all engineering fields shaping the future of global technological advancement\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

resistance of parasites to currently utilized drugs underscores the critical need for the identification of new antimalarial therapies Here we aimed to identify potential new drug candidates against Plasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria by analyzing the transcriptomes of different life stages of the parasite and identifying highly expressed genes We searched for genes that were expressed in all stages of the parasites life cycle including the asexual blood stage gametocyte stage liver stage and sexual stages in the insect vector using transcriptomics data from publicly available databases From this analysis we found  overlapping genes including  essential ones By searching through drug target databases we discovered  potential drug targets and  associated bioactive compounds We sought to expand this analysis to similar compounds to known drugs So we found a list of  similar compounds which we predicted as actives and inactives using previously developed machine learning models against five life stages of Plasmodium spp From this analysis two compounds were selected and the reactions were experimentally evaluated The compounds HSP and silvestrol aglycone showed potent inhibitory activity at nanomolar concentrations against the P falciparum D strain asexual blood stage Moreover silvestrol aglycone exhibited low cytotoxicity in mammalian cells
